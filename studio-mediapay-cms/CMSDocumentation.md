## File Structure & Code Flow Documentation

This document explains the overall architecture and code flow of the Sanity CMS based on the provided codebase.

---

### 1. File Structure Overview

- **Root Files** 
    - **sanity.cli.ts:** Sets up the Sanity CLI commands and configuration for auto-updates.  
    - **sanity.config.ts:** Main configuration file for the Sanity Studio, including schema types and plugins.

- **Directories**  
    - **schemaTypes/**  
        - `postType.ts`: Defines the schema for blog posts including fields like title, slug, description, publishedAt, image, body, author, tags, and category reference.  
        - `categoryType.ts`: Contains the schema definition for categories (imported in the schema).  
        - **home/**  
            - `carouselType.ts`: Defines carousel-related content for the home page.  
            - `heroHomeSection.ts`: Contains the configuration for the hero section on the home page.  
            - `PopularSection.ts`: Defines various popular section configurations (list, popular, spotlight) for the home page.  
            - `index.ts`: Likely aggregates and exports the home page schema types.
        - `index.ts`: Aggregates all schema type definitions (categories, posts, and home-related types) for use in the main studio configuration.
    - **static/**  
        - `.gitkeep`: Placeholder to ensure the directory is tracked by Git.

### 2. Code Flow & Configuration

#### Sanity Studio Initialization
- **sanity.cli.ts:**  
    Uses `defineCliConfig` to specify project details (projectId and dataset) and enable auto-updates. When you run CLI commands (e.g., `sanity dev`, `sanity start`), this configuration ensures the studio connects to the correct backend.

- **sanity.config.ts:**  
    - Uses `defineConfig` to initialize the studio configuration.  
    - Specifies the project name, title, ID, and dataset.  
    - Integrates plugins such as the structure tool (for custom content structures) and Vision tool (for running queries against your data).  
    - Imports the schema types from the `schemaTypes/index.ts` file, which aggregates all document schemas.  
    - This configuration is central for building and customizing the studio's behavior.

#### Schema Management
- **schemaTypes/index.ts:**  
    - Imports individual schema definitions (`postType`, `categoryType`, and elements from the `home` folder).  
    - Registers these schemas as part of the Sanity Studio content model.
    
- **Schema Files (e.g., postType.ts):**  
    - Define specific document types. For instance, `postType.ts` outlines the structure for a blog post including validation requirements and field definitions.  
    - These files use helper functions like `defineField` and `defineType` from Sanity to ensure a clear, validated schema.

#### Package Management & Tooling
- **package.json:**  
    - Contains scripts (`dev`, `start`, `build`, `deploy`, `deploy-graphql`) to interact with the Sanity CLI, facilitating local development and production deployment.  
    - Lists dependencies such as React, Sanity, and styled-components alongside devDependencies for linting and type-checking, ensuring a robust development environment.

- **TypeScript Support:**  
    - The `tsconfig.json` supports TypeScript configurations for better code quality and developer experience.

### 3. Development & Deployment Workflow

1. **Setup and Development:**  
     - Developers modify the schema files under `schemaTypes/` to update content models.  
     - Run `sanity dev` or `sanity start` to launch the studio with the updated configurations.

2. **Building the Studio:**  
     - Use `sanity build` to compile the studio into a production-ready bundle.

3. **Deployment:**  
     - Deploy the compiled studio using `sanity deploy` to update the live environment.  
     - Utilize `deploy-graphql` if GraphQL is used to access Sanity's APIs.

4. **Content Editing:**  
     - Once deployed, content creators use the Sanity Studio to manage and edit content in a real-time interface, leveraging custom schemas and plugins configured in the studio setup.

### 4. Summary

The CMS codebase is structured to separate concerns clearly:
- The root directory holds configuration and tooling scripts.
- The `schemaTypes/` folder centralizes all content schema definitions.
- The Sanity configuration files (`sanity.cli.ts` and `sanity.config.ts`) tie the project together, providing a reliable interface between the frontend studio and backend content database.

This modular approach simplifies maintenance, allows for easy updates of the schema, and ensures that the Sanity Studio remains scalable and robust.
